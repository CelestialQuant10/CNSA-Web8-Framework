# CNSA-Web8-Framework

A quantum-secure framework implementing CNSA 2.0 standards for decentralized digital economies, with Web8-inspired integrations for resilient blockchain applications.

## Overview
This repository provides tools and examples for integrating NSA's CNSA 2.0 post-quantum cryptography (e.g., CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium) into decentralized systems. It supports secure key exchange, signatures, and data integrity in environments like Solana-based economies, addressing quantum threats while enabling efficient, decentralized operations.

## Features
- Quantum-resistant encryption and key management.
- Decentralized examples for token transfers and AI agent interactions.
- Compliance with NIST PQC standards and CNSA migration timelines.
- Modular design for easy extension to Web8 concepts (e.g., privacy-enhanced networks).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/CelestialQuant10/CNSA-Web8-Framework.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install cryptography pqclean` (or equivalent for your environment).
3. Run examples: `python src/key_exchange.py`

## Usage
See `/examples` for demos, including secure key establishment.
